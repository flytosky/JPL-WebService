Observation data (e.g., from the A-Train satellite constellation) and model data 
(e.g., from ECMWF analysis) live in their own respective grid spaces, have 
different sampling characteristics, and use different formats and structures 
in archiving. This deters synergistic usage of these datasets, e.g., to use 
one instrument to calibrate another, or to conduct model data assimilation 
using observation. In response to the challenge, we have built a software tool 
to facilitate the co-location of A-Train and ECMWF data. That is, to interpolate 
from a source data grid onto that of a target. This tool is written in Python 
with C extension, has RESTful web interfaces in the frontend, and uses 
parallel computing for high performance in the backend. In this presentation, 
we will focus on the computer science aspects of this tool, namely the 
architectural design, the infrastructure of the web services, the approach 
to parallelization, and the key algorithms being used for, e.g., 
linear-scaling nearest neighbor search among different grids. Some use cases 
and their scientific significance will also be discussed briefly.
